Welcome to the website for the **Machine Learning for Geoscience & Earth Observation (ML4GEO)** research group at the University of Edinburgh!

If you are a researcher at the University of Edinburgh using or interested in using geospatial machine learning techniques, please do join the community: [JOIN THE ML4GEO TEAMS](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aexample-link).

ML4GEO is a new initiative set up in the 2024/25 academic year by PhD students from Geosciences, Informatics, and Maths who found they used similar methods and that discussing was mutually beneficial. We hope that ML4GEO will become a group that encourages interdisciplinary collaboration across schools and disciplines, fostering a supportive environment for sharing ideas, resources, and expertise in geospatial machine learning.

If you are interested in getting involved, please check out our [upcoming events](events.qmd) and [resources](resources.qmd), or get in touch! We are always looking for people to help with organising and contributing to the development of the group.
