We hope that ML4GEO will become a group that encourages interdisciplinary collaboration across schools and disciplines, fostering a supportive environment for sharing ideas, resources, and expertise in geospatial machine learning.\nWe hold regular meetings during the semester and you will find details about this on the ML4GEO Teams Channel. If you are interested in getting more involved, please get in touch with one of our committee! We are always looking for people to help with organising and contributing to the development of the group."

Join us at ML4GEO for a 2-day event on July 22-23 at the Edinburgh Futures Institute. where weâ€™ll collaborate to generate ideas and explore use cases together. No technical expertise required!\nGeospatial Foundation models (GFMs) are revolutionising geospatial machine learning (TerraMind, SSL4EO-S12 , Google Embeddings,â€¦ ) with state-of-the-art performance and generalizability across sensors/regions and benchmark spatial imaging tasks.\nOur Ideathon/Hackathon aims to: * Provide a brief introduction to GFMs. * Offer space for discussion and idea generation for applications. * Facilitate group work to develop prototypes and implement ideas using actual GFMs and FM embeddings.\nYouâ€™ll have the opportunity to identify your own problem and choose which GFM and data to use, facilitating a self-driven learning experience!\nSign-ups here!"
