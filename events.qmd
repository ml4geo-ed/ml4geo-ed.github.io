# **22/07/2025 - Geospatial Foundation Models Ideathon/Hackathon**

ML4GEO is a research group passionate about connecting geospatial sciences with machine learning! 

This month, we're excited to host our inaugural Ideathon/Hackathon focused on Geospatial Foundation Models! Join us at ML4GEO for a 2-day event on July 22-23 at the Edinburgh Futures Institute. where we'll collaborate to generate ideas and explore use cases together. No technical expertise required!

Geospatial Foundation models (GFMs) are revolutionising geospatial machine learning (TerraMind, SSL4EO-S12 , Google Embeddings,â€¦ ) with state-of-the-art performance and generalizability across sensors/regions and benchmark spatial imaging tasks. 

Our Ideathon/Hackathon aims to:
* Provide a brief introduction to GFMs.
* Offer space for discussion and idea generation for applications.
* Facilitate group work to develop prototypes and implement ideas using actual GFMs and FM embeddings. 

You'll have the opportunity to identify your own problem and choose which GFM and data to use, facilitating a self-driven learning experience!
